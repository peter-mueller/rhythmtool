== Create a rhythm by text

A rhythm represents a sequential arrangement of hits and pauses. This creates a beat.
It has no defined meter, so the interpration for playing must be done by the user.
For example a rhythm with length 12 can be seen as a 3/4 beat with sixteenth notes or
a 12/8 beat with eight notes.
